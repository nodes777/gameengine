# Chapter 7 - Manipulating the Camera

* Implement operations that are commonly employed by manipulating a camera
* Interpolate values between old and new to create a smooth transition
* Understand how some motions or behaviors can be described by simple mathematic formulations
* Build games with multiple camera views
* Transform positions from the Canvas Coordinate space to the World Coordinate (WC) space
* Program with mouse input in a game environment with multiple cameras

The WC window is the bounds defined by a WC center and a dimension of Wwc Ã— Hwc

setUpViewProjection encapsulates details and enables drawing of game obkects inside the WC window bounds

## Chapter 7.1 - Camera Manipulations

* To experience some of the common camera manipulation operations
* To understand the mapping from manipulation operations to the corresponding camera parameter values that must be altered
* To implement camera manipulation operations

## Chapter 7.2 - Camera Manipulations

Provide interpolation so the camera movements aren't as janky

* To understand interpolated results between given values
* To implement interpolation supporting gradual camera parameter changes
* To experience interpolated changes in camera parameters

## Chapter 7.3 - Camera Shake

Shake will be created with a damped harmonic function

* To gain some insights into modeling displacements with simple mathematical functions
* To experience with the camera shake effect
* To implement camera shake as a pseudorandom damped simple harmonic motion

Q key will shake
