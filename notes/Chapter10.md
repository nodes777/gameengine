## Backgrounds - Tiling and Parallax

Background depth creates further complexity to capture players interest.

## 10.1 Layer Manager and Background Tiling

To compute the required tiling, determine the tile position that covers the lower-left corner of the WC bound and tile in the positive X and Y directions

Experience working with multiple layers of background
Implement the tiling of background objects for camera WC window bounds
