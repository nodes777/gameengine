## Backgrounds - Tiling and Parallax

Background depth creates further complexity to capture players interest.

## 10.1 Layer Manager and Background Tiling

To compute the required tiling, determine the tile position that covers the lower-left corner of the WC bound and tile in the positive X and Y directions

Experience working with multiple layers of background
Implement the tiling of background objects for camera WC window bounds

## 10.2 Parallax Scrolling

Understand and appreciate motion parallax
Simulate motion parallax with parallax scrolling

## 10.3 Layer Manager

5 typical layersin a game

Heads-up display (HUD) layer: Typically closest to the camera displaying essential user interface information

Foreground or front layer: The layer in front of the game objects for decorative or partial occlusion of the game objects

Actor layer: The default distance layer in Figure 10-5, where all game objects reside

Shadow Receiver layer: The layer behind the actor layer to receive potential shadows

Background layer: The decorative background
