# Chapter 8 - Implementing Illumination and Shadow

* Understand the parameters of simple illumination models
* Define infrastructure supports for working with multiple light sources
* Understand the basics of diffuse reflection and normal mapping
* Understand the basics of specular reflection and the Phong illumination model
* Implement GLSL shaders to simulate diffuse and specular reflection and the Phong illumination model
* Create and manipulate point, directional, and spotlights
* Simulate shadows with the WebGL stencil buffer

Using the Phong illumination model.

Elements in the Phong Model

* Ambient Light
* Light Source
* Multiple Light Sources
* Diffuse Reflection and Normal Maps - Simulates diffuse lighting and reflection in 2D
* Specular Light and Material - Models reflecting light off surfaces and reaching the camera
* Light Source Types - Introduces illumination based on different types of light sources
* Shadow - Approximates results from light occulsion
