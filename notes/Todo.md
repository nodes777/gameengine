# Game Engine To Dos
	* Switch to ES6
	* Create JSON parser instead of XML
	* Rewrite boolean checks isAssetLoaded => assetIsLoaded
	* Write functional versions of TextureRenderable_PixelCollision, for TextureRenderable.prototype._indexToWCPosition and its inverse
	* Rewrite the dumb function names in Engine_Input, like isButtonPressed(), which is way too close to the array name mIsButtonPressed
